# Scraping the Topics page of Github
### By: Rajarshi Bhattacharjee
This is my first attempt at making a web scraping project using Beautiful Soup, Requests and Pandas.
Site scraped: github.com/topics
Algorithm:
- Get a list of topics
- Collect top 25 repositories under each topic and extract their urls , stars and username
- Create a CSV for each topic


###### Acknowledgement:
I referred to a video by Jovian youtube channel titled "Building a web scraping project from scratch" to create this project of mine.
